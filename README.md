## Hourly Event Guide #

> What are the hourly events?

- Every hour there is an event called hourly event also called arms race.
- These gives rewards if if you follow whatever is required in the event
- Each hourly event has a duration of 55 minutes
- Each hourly event has 3 rewards chests, Blue, Purple, Gold
- The Gold chest reward is better than the purple which is better than the blue chest

> What are the benefits?

- Each hourly event has 3 rewards chests, Blue, Purple, Gold
- The Gold chest is better than the purple which is better than the blue chest
- The rewards may include Gems, Resources, Advance Teleports, Hero Tokens, speed ups etc


> Are these Hourly Events important to do ?

Yes very important!

- Hourly events give you resources that go directly to your bag which cannot be looted
- You should always be doing some building/researching/training. 
- But if you smartly plan these upgrades so that they finish during a relevant event you get rewards
- Big rewards!
- You will probably even stop feeling the need for looting other players if you plan these properly.

> What are the tasks and challenges of these Hourly Events?

- Each hourly event has some activity to perform
- Ex: increase building power, research power, use speed ups, train troops etc
- Doing such activities give you points
- These points can then be used to get the rewards chests

> How to do these events properly?

- Your goal should be to open the maximum number of chests as possible.
- *Maths*, Yes, you haven't escaped maths even in this game 🤦‍♂️. But I assure you it's all simple, just keep a calculator handy.
- For each activity you get points, for example 1 building power gives you 1000 points. So if you can increase 80 building power by upgrades, you get 80×1000=80,000 points, which opens the Blue chest.
- if you do the calculation before you start then you easily know what chests you can open.

> A mistake I did while doing one of these events:

I tried to do an event called Building+Building Speedup

But to reach the gold chest it takes 13 million points.
And I got lazy and didn't do the maths so got stuck at 11.8 million points.
Not only I didn't get the gold chest.
But I wasted like 6 million points that I could have used in other points.
🤦‍♂️

## Getting gold chest in Hero events #

Event details:
    - Recruitment points
    - Unlock Skill points
    - Hero level up points
    - spend wisdom medal points
    - exchange hero medal points
Startegy:
    The best way to do this is the following:
    - Check your heroes and make a note of the green ones
    - level up the hero to lvl6 (for 2nd skill unlock) and lvl12(for 3rd skill unlock)
    - spend some wisdom medal to upgrade skill (I upgrade to skill lvl 3)
    - Dismiss the hero (only for heroes that are not stationed or in legion)
    - Dismissing hero gives back 80% of the gold and wisdom medal you used on it
    - exchange the green hero medal in Arena
    - Don't use tickets before clearing up the green heroes since duplicates directly become medals
        and then you can't do all the stuf twice.
    - try to save hero tickets to use 10 at a time you get 1 extra pull from that
    - ** If you get a Orange hero duplicate, 
      ** do NOT exchange that medal, 
      ** save it to unlock Skill 6

How to dismiss hero?
- First remove them from legion or station
- Then click on the hero
- On the top right corner click the open book button
- On bottom left you will find the dismiss button

## Farm Guide #

If you wanna be a big player and don't wanna spend thousands of dollars you need something 
called farms. These are different than the farm building we have in our castle 
or the Farm gathering plot in the map.

What I am talking about are farm castles. These farm castles are owned by you. You create them with 
seperate email IDs and you control everything inside them.

As the name suggest these castles are you personal farms, there to give you 
resource required for growing your main castle.

This is legal in Rise of Empire game, and pretty much everyone does it. 
If you don't want to pay a lot of money you need make farms.

> How to make farm accounts?
** Hopefully you have your main castle bound to some email ID
Goto menu > 3 dots > account > start a new game
This will create a new game in a newer state.
Before you reach Castle level 6 you need to move to your main state.
After castle level 6, there is nothing you can do to change state.
After playing the game for a bit, when you are able to acess the map screen, you have to move.

> How to change state?
Before reaching castle level 6, goto map > the state view > all state map
Find your main state from here, go inside and then click on an empty tile.
You will be given the option of "Change Zone", click it and you will be in the main state.

> Buildings in Farm account:
Castle level: level 13 (as fast as possible) and level 16 (slowly)
Storages: Max level. Castle 13 allows you to get the extrac storage
Resource production buildings: max level
Mint: max level 
Trading house (baloon): min level 10
stable: lvl 2
Training grounds: slowly max level
Medical tent: Max level
Military buildings: No need to upgrade military buildings (watch tower, fortress etc)

> Troops in farm account:
We use troops only for gathering.
3 legion full of T1 cavalry.
T1 cavalry have the higest load capacity.

> Technology in farm account:
Town development tech tree: max level
Rapid production tech tree: max level
Legion research: unlock 1st hero in 3 legions and do 5/5 in high-speed gather and take it all
(Clash of province) Do as much as COP research as possible in farm

Strategies:
- Choose farmer class at the beginning
- Complete daily task everyday
- Fill 3 legions with T1 cavs, (upgrade hero S1 and training ground for legion capacity)
- Only keep blue hero in legion
- Send 3 legion to gather the resource you need
- Ensure that your storage capacity is more than depot protection
- trade resources in baloon
- Depending on the number of farms, after reaching c13 divide them into trader and farmer class.
    Trader class 
        Pros:
        - Has very low depot protection, so you are able to loot more resources.
        - Better gold production
        Cons:
        - gathering capacity low
        - resource production low
    Farmer class has high resource production and gathering capacity,
        Pros:
        - gathering capacity high
        - resource production high
        Cons:
        - Has very high depot protection, so you need to have high storage level.
        - low gold production
- before attacking with your main castle, keep the troops out       
- If your main is a raider class, before going offline spend the stamina of the class legion to loot gold
    from farm, since gold is the hardest to get and you get only a certain amount per hit.
    Think of it as spending stamina to get gold from the farm.
- Orange or purple heroes in farms are not useful, you trade them in to complete hero day gold chest
- During hero day, complete as many gold chests as possible, even if that means you need to 
    exchange orange hero medals for wisdom medals.

## Hero/Legion Guide #

Heroes are probably the most important thing in the game.
You hero stats decide whether you will win or loose in a fight.
Developing hero must be one of your highest priority task in this game.

In this guide I will give a more overview of hero guide since Hero game mechanics is 
probably the most complex in this game in my opinion and it takes time and patience 
to understand it fully. It tooke me the longest time to learn and I still don't believe
I know enough about heroes.

There are 2 type of heroes: Combat and Development
As the name suggest any combat hero participates in combat and development hero helps 
your castle development.

There are 4 rarity of heroes (at least in this early stage, later there will be other heroes):
(You can know which hero is of which rarity by the background color of the hero picture)
    1) Green heroes: very common heroes, not important
    2) Blue heroes: common, not important (*1 certain exceptions, explained later)
        - Has 4 unlockable skills
    3) Purple Heroes: uncommon, important, should be used if no orange hero alternative
        - Has 6 unlockable skills
    4) Orange Heroes: Rare, very important, must be handled very carefully !
        - Has 8 unlockable skills

Each Combat hero has 2 type of skills:
    Leadership Skill (green background): Skill 1,3,4,6,7
    Combat Skill (red background): Skill 2, 5, 8
    
    [ I will call the skills as S1, S2, S3 .... S8 from now on]

Which skills are extremely important?
    Skill 1 increases your legion capacity, which means more troops will fit into your legion,
        and more troops in battle is always better
    Skill 6 gives bonus to skill 1, there by increasing the legion capacity even more.
    !! If you have a duplicate of an Orange hero (meaning you got an Orange hero twice) then
        save that medal and get that Orange hero to level 35, so that you can unlock Skill 6.
    Combat skills are important too and can play a deciding factor whether you win or loose.

    As per my recommendation work on  S1 first, then S6 if possible then do the other skills
    depending on the number of wisdom medals you have. But if you do have the hero medal to open skill 6,
    then that should be your top priority.

Combat Skill Info:
    If you click on any combat skills (red skill, S2, S5, S8) of an hero you can see certain information:
        Type: combat 
        Effective Range: {some range depending on the hero}
        Target: {some target depending on the hero}

        I would like you to look at the these info of your orange heroes very carefully.
        The "Effective Range" is probably the most important information.
        It is the range of your hero's skill.
    - Dual Blade Example
        So for example Dual Blade hero's S2 has an Effective Range of 3, so it means that her skills
        will work on any of the 3 rows in front of where she is placed.

        That means, if you place Dual blade at the front row, all the 3 rows of the enemy is within 
        her range to attack. if you place her in the 2nd row, she can hit only the first 2 rows of enemy
        since there is one friendly row in front of her. If she is placed in the 3rd row, she can only hit 
        the enemy's 1st row.

        it is recommended for this range reason, to keep dual blade in the mid row.

    - Orochi Example:
        Orochi's S2 has an effective range of 2, so it means that she can only hit 2 rows in front of her
        If she is placed in the 3rd row of your legion, her combat skill will never activate.

        For this reason, orochi is always a front row hero.
    - Heaven's Justice Example:
        Justice has S2 range of 5, which means he can hit 5 rows in front of him.
        He is the perfect back row hero, as he can attack any of the 3 enemy rows even while sitting at
        the last row.

Legion Guide:
    Now that you have some idea about Range, you have to look at the range of your heroes and 
    decide where to place them.
    Lower combat skill range will mean that you place it in the front.
    Higher combat skill range will mean you place it at the back.

    I personally use Orochi - Dual Blade - Heaven's Justice in 1st, 2nd , 3rd rows respectively

Quick tips:
    - Try to have your front row hero have high defence and more troops, since the row which is at the 
        front always gets hit the hardest. If you have high defence, then it means more time for your 
        heroes to survive and they can activate their combat skills.
    - Don't invest medals and experience in any heroes other than orange ones if possible. Saving
        the medals and hero experiences means once you get lucky and get an orange hero, you can make it
        great very fast.
    - Don't open S5 unless you have used the hero's medal to open S6 first. 
        Example: I got Orochu 3 times, so during the 1st duplicate I opened S6 and only then
        I opened S5. If didn't get Orochi 3 times, I wouldn't have ever opened S5 before doing S6.

*1) Some blue heroes like Lady Knight, Shifu, The Sergeant are very important since
    they give bonus to troop training like speed and count increases.

Note: There is a lot more to heroes than what I have mentioned above. But this is a good starting point.

## COP Quick Tip #

1) What is 50% Clash of Province Score?
The item 50% COP bonus is very important because it is a "point multiplier".
In simple terms, if you get 1000 points from 1 building power, using the 50% COP bonus will 
give you 1000 + 50% of 1000 = 1500 points.
This helps a lot when you are trying to reach Clash of Province Gold chest.
Note: The 50% COP bonus works only for 30 min.

2) How to use COP bonus score? (except for gather day)
The best way to use COP bonus is between 2 hourly events that you can get gold chest for.
You start the cop score at the last 10 min of the 1st hourly event so that it continues 
to the next event. You get 2 hourly gold chest and COP gold chest.
You can check the event schedule in the Appgamer website.

2.2) How to use COP Bonus score on Gather day?
For gather day, you use COP bonus in the following way:
- just before recalling (or if fast do it during your troops are  marching back), put on COP bonus
- right after they come back send them off to gather.
- recall them just before the cop 30 min is up

3) What does "Exchange" do for the 50% COP Bonus?
You can exchange four 50% COP bonus to get one 100% COP bonus.
100% COP bonus will mutliply the points by 2.
So for 1000 points for 1 building power, you will get 2000 points.
My recommendation: Don't exchange and make 100% COP bonus unless you have 4-6 or more chests unlocked.
The extra points become useless unless it opens a chest.

## Easy way to get the material thats hardest to get for your troop type:

One of the best way to get equipment is to buy green chests from store.
They cost 250 gems each and will give you (green) 3 out of the 4 materials that you require very easily.
The 4th material is always the hardest to get:
    - Cavalry: Dragon Tendon (looks like a wire)
    - Archer:  Wolf Hide (looks like wolf's skin)
    - Footmen: Secret Order (looks like a scroll)

The way to get these requires a bit of gambling:
- First dissasemble the 4th material to all white color.
- Then find the equipment which take 1 white 4th material. It is the equipment called "amulet" or "accessory"
    = Example: For steel cavalry, the amulet is Jade Belt and the accessory is Cowl, that requires 1 4th material
- Your goal is to craft GREEN amulet or accessory:
    = Put green material for all excpet the 4th material.
    = (OPTIONAL) You can spend gems to craft the equipment instantly
    = This will give you a 66% chance that your equipment will turn out to be green.
- 3 out of 4 times the above crafting will give you green equipment.
- You can dissasemble this green equipment to get green materials including a GREEN 4th material.
- So even though you put in WHITE 4th material you can get GREEN back
- However, if it fails to make a green equipment, you will end up having a white equipment
    = Which means all the material that you get back will be white.
    = So you loose the green materials you put in, but you will mostly have an abundance of those anyways.
    = With this method you don't loose a single 4th material. 
    = Even if the equipment turns out to be white, you still get back the white 4th material that you put.
- In summary:
    = Buy green chests from store`
    = Craft amulet or accessory with 3 green and 1 white material (4th material)
    = dissasemble the equipment to get back the materials 
    = Rinse and repeat 
- Enjoy!

## Clash of Provine Guide #

Clash of Province (COP) is the State vs State event which runs every week after first month in the state.
Every week you get new States as opponents and throughout the week you compete in different challenges daily

During the initial days of the COP, you get the COP "Opening" Challenge, during which there 
    will NOT be any State vs State Kill Event. Instead you get "Free Development", 
    which means that you can choose from the events of Day 1 to Day 5

The challenges each day are as follows:
Day 1 (Monday):     Gathering Day
Day 2 (Tuesday):    Buidling Day
Day 3 (Wednesday):  Research Day
Day 4 (Thursday):   Hero Development Day
Day 5 (Friday):     Troop Training Day
Day 6/7 (Sat/Sun):  State vs State Kill Event (except for COP Opening competetion)

> Most Important Thing to do for COP:
Research the Technology tree called Zone Commemoration.
To unlock this you will need your Research Institute to be level 8.
This Technology helps by "increasing gathering speed", "increasing gather load capacity", 
"unlock extra COP chests", "increase COP points earned" etc.
You will need Courage Medals to research this and so you need to save those medals.

### How to get courage medals:
1) Hitting monsters
2) Exchange courage medals with hero tokens in token shop in benefit center 
    (You get hero tokens from Gold Chests) (50 courage medals for 15 tokens is the best deal,
     you can refresh the shop with 200 gems until you get deals like that)
3) Courage medals are also received from Purple and Gold Clash of Province Chests 
    (anything from Chest 2 gives courage medals)

> COP Gathering Day Guide:

Gather Day is very easy for a Farmer class, due to higher gather load capacity and speed.
However as Raider, it is very tough to get Gold chest.
A few tips for getting gold chest:

    1. Rearrange your heroes so that all your legions have uniform gather load capacity.    
        In simple terms, if your legions have similar load capacity i.e. the total amount of resource
        the legion can gather, then all your legions will have similar gather time.
        Having similar gather time is very useful, since that will help you to plan ahead when 
        to put on the COP bonus and recall troops.
    
    1. Start gathering on Sunday, the day before the Gather Day. (it is risky since enemies might
            hit your gathering tiles, but it is a risk you will have to take)
    1. Gather bonus item is probably your best friend in helping you get gold chest:    
            Let me tell you a trick with Gather:
            - Gather Bonus increases gathering speed 
            - I like to think of it like a gather time reduction item.
            - What I do is: 
              * I start my gathering and note the gather time of all the legions.
              * Usually I have similar gather time, say 8 hours.
            -
